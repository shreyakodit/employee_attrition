# Employee Attrition Forecasting

This is a Machine Learning model which predicts the attrition possibility by implementing the Random Forest Algorithm. 
Further, the data explorations and analysis is done using the libraries seaborn, matplotlib, pygal, cufflinks and aif360 among others.
Achieved good accuracy on the 'IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance' dataset from Kaggle, using Logistic Regression.
